## Node version

## How to run a game server
Taro engine will run games made using [modd.io](https://www.modd.io).

To run the game server, execute the following command:
```
npm run server --game=<gameID>
```
*if the gameID argument is not provided, then the engine will use game.json stored in root directory instead.

Your game's Game ID can be found in your modd.io's game's sandbox ([example](https://beta.modd.io/sandbox/game/two-houses/scripts)). Go to menu -> about.
